This is a simplified version of how a coffee machine is programed. 
Here, the customer has different drinks which he can choose from and the machine is accepting payment in coins 
(quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies).  
If the resources(money, water, milk, coffee) are enough, the chosen drink will be made and resources deducted, else some message will be displayed on the screen.
For the maintenance persons there are some others functionalities e.g. display report or turn off the machine.
